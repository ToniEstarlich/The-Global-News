## Troubleshooting
### Issue: `SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module`

- **Cause**: Jest encountered an import statement but wasn't configured for ES Modules.
- **Solution**: Ensure Babel is configured to transform your code:

```bash
npm install --save-dev babel-jest @babel/core @babel/preset-env
```
---
### Issue: `Jest encountered an unexpected token`

- **Cause**: Jest needs to be configured to support ES Modules or JSX.
- **Solution**: In your `package.json`, make sure the following configuration is added for Jest:

```json
"jest": {
  "testEnvironment": "jsdom"
}
```
---
## Why Integrate Babel and Node Modules?

After running tests for the `about-header.js` component, you might encounter issues related to Jest not properly handling ES modules or JSX syntax. This is where Babel and the necessary node modules come into play. Here's why and how to integrate them:

### 1. **Why Use Babel?**
   Babel is a tool that allows you to use the latest JavaScript features (like ES6 modules or JSX) in your code while ensuring compatibility with older JavaScript environments. Jest, by default, may not understand the newer syntax unless you explicitly tell it to use Babel for transpiling. 

### 2. **Why Configure Jest?**
   Jest runs tests in a Node.js environment, which is different from a browser. If you're using ES modules or JSX, Jest won't be able to parse them without the right configuration. This is why we need to set up Babel to transpile the code before Jest can run the tests properly.

### 3. **Steps to Integrate Babel and Node Modules**

   - **Install Babel and Related Dependencies**:
     Babel can be integrated into your project using the following npm packages: `babel-jest`, `@babel/core`, and `@babel/preset-env`. These packages allow Jest to understand modern JavaScript syntax.

     To install Babel, run the following command in your project directory:

     ```bash
     npm install --save-dev babel-jest @babel/core @babel/preset-env
     ```

   - **Configure Jest to Use Babel**:
     After installing Babel, you need to tell Jest to use it by adding the `transform` configuration to your `package.json`. This ensures that Jest uses Babel to transpile `.js` files during testing.

     In your `package.json`, add the following Jest configuration:

     ```json
     "jest": {
       "transform": {
         "^.+\\.js$": "babel-jest"
       }
     }
     ```

     This configuration ensures that all `.js` files in your project will be processed by `babel-jest` before Jest runs the tests.

### 4. **Benefit**
   By integrating Babel and configuring Jest in this way, you'll be able to use modern JavaScript features like ES modules and JSX, while also ensuring that your tests run smoothly without any syntax errors.

# Footer Component
---
## Overview
<img src="./assets/wireframes_components/footer_component.png" alt="Desktop Screenshot" width="330"><br>
## Footer Component Design
The footer component of the project is a crucial part of the website's layout, providing essential information and links in a clean and user-friendly manner. Here's a breakdown of its design:

## Purpose:
The footer is designed to provide additional site navigation, social media links, and legal information (such as copyright details) in a simple, compact format.

## Responsiveness:
The design ensures that the footer adapts to different screen sizes, maintaining accessibility and functionality on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Structure:
It consists of multiple sections:

## Contact Information:
 Provides details like the company address, email, and phone number.
Social Media Links: Displays icons that link to the project's social media accounts.
Legal Information: Includes copyright information and links to privacy policies or terms of service.

While running npm test in the project, you may encounter the following error message:

```bash
Validation Error:
 Module <rootDir>/setupTests.js in the setupFilesAfterEnv option was not found.
 ```
This occurs because Jest is looking for a setupTests.js file to configure the testing environment, such as adding custom matchers from @testing-library/jest-dom. Without this file, Jest will not know how to properly set up the environment for testing.

---
## Solution: Adding setupTests.js
Create the setupTests.js File:
Add a new file called setupTests.js in the root directory of your project, next to package.json.

## Add Jest DOM Import:
Import @testing-library/jest-dom into the setupTests.js file:

```javascript

import '@testing-library/jest-dom';
Update Jest Configuration:
```
In your package.json, add a setupFilesAfterEnv key to the Jest configuration. This will tell Jest where to look for the setup file.

## Example:

```json

"jest": {
  "testEnvironment": "jsdom",
  "transform": {
    "^.+\\.js$": "babel-jest"
  },
  "setupFilesAfterEnv": ["<rootDir>/setupTests.js"]
}
```
## Run Tests Again:
Once the setup is complete, running npm test will ensure that Jest sets up the environment correctly for testing.

---
## File Details
- **Component File**: `./components/footer.js`
- **Stylesheet**: `./css/footer.css`
- **Wireframe Design**: `./assets/wireframes_components/footer_component.png`
---
## Test Results After Fix
After making the necessary changes to the Jest setup, running npm test will ensure that the environment is correctly set up for testing, including for the footer component. This will also confirm the functionality and design integrity of the footer.

```bash
> npm test

> the-global-news@1.0.0 test
> jest
